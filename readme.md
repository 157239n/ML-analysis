This is essentially the root folder for all ML projects. Should work seemlessly with k1lib's upcoming projects module. Each folder here is supposed to be a radically new architecture. After each run, there should be report files like 01.py for analysis and repeatability. Analysis files should also be in the folder, for quick presentation of ran benchmarks
